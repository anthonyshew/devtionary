# Integer

---

## Beginner

A numerical sequence of digits, like "12345."
Integers can be created as primitives, from literals, or as objects.

---

## Intermediate

Integers hold data that is represented in numeric form.
They can be created as primitives, from literals or as objects.

Integers can only store numerical values. Any attemps of normal string operations will result in unexpected behaviors.

---

## Advanced

`Integer` objects and `Integer` primitives are similar in JavaScript and can usually be used interchangeably.
There are situations in which differences will be found. However, these disparities are minimal.

---

## Examples

### In Code

```js
const integer = 12345;
```

### In Conversation

> A Javascript integer is much like mathematical numbers, the lines of a book, or anywhere or else that you can read some number characters!
