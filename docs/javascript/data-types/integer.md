# Integer

---

## Beginner

A numerical sequence of digits, like `12345`.
Integers can be created as primitives, from literals, or as objects.

---

## Intermediate

Integers hold data that is represented in numeric form.
They can be created as primitives, from literals or as objects.

Integers can only store numerical values. A common "gotcha" in JavaScript is confusing integers and numbers for strings. If you try to use methods for numbers on a mistaken string, these operations can result in unexpected behaviors.

---

## Advanced

`Integer` objects and `Integer` primitives are similar in JavaScript and can usually be used interchangeably.
There are situations in which differences can be found. However, these disparities are minimal.

---

## Examples

### In Code

```js
const integer = 12345;
```

### In Conversation

> A Javsacript integer is much like mathematical numbers, the lines of a book, or anywhere or else that you can read some number characters!
