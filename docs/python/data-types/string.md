# String

---

## Beginner

A sequence of characters, like "Devtionary." Strings are written with quotes.

A simple string can be created by using double quotes (`"`) or single quotes (`'`).

Strings can also include numeric characters (1, 2, 100) and symbols (!@#).

---

## Intermediate

Strings hold data that can be represented in text form. They can be created as primitives, from string literals or as objects.

Extra care should be taken when working with string and number data types together, as unexpected behaviors can occur.

---

## Advanced

`String` objects and `String` primitives are quite similar in Python and can usually be used interchangeably. There are situations in which differences will be found. However, these disparities are minimal.

---

## Examples

### In Code

```py
string = "Hello, this is a string!"
```

### In Conversation

> A Python string is much like text on a billboard, the lines of a book, or anywhere or else that you can read some text characters!
