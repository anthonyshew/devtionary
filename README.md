# Welcome!
## Welcome to the developer's dictionary that you have always needed!

We strive to create a book of programming words that you may not quite know - or just need a refresher on.
The Devtionary is meant to be accessible and useful for any level of developer - from absolute beginner to 30 year veteran.

## Local Development

Devtionary is built using Docusaurus, a React.js documentation framework.

To run Devtionary locally on your machine:

```
yarn install
yarn start

```

Or:

```
yarn start

```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Testing

We may or may not add testing based on how robust this project becomes. While some tests may be helpful, they may be mostly written to help people get familiar with

## Reporting Bugs and Issues

Please open an issue for us here on Github using the template. Thank you!
