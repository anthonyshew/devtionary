# Welcome to the developer's dictionary that you have always needed!

https://devtionary.app

We strive to create a book of programming words that you may not quite know - or just need a refresher on.
The Devtionary is meant to be accessible and useful for any level of developer - from absolute beginner to 30 year veteran.

## Local Development

Devtionary is built using Docusaurus, a React.js documentation framework.

To run Devtionary locally on your machine:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Or:

```
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

*Please note that the number of definitions shown in the local environment will not change until you run `npm run start` again. If you add another definition to a language, the home page won't reflect that new number until you restart.*

## Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Testing

We may or may not add testing based on how robust this project becomes. While some tests may be helpful, they may be mostly written to help people get familiar with

## Reporting Bugs and Issues

Please open an issue for us here on Github using the template. Thank you!
